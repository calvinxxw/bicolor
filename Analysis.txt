Research on the Rules of Double Color Ball Lottery from the Perspective of Modeling and Analysis: Feasible Angles and Dimensions for Modeling
From the perspective of modeling and analysis, the core of studying the Double Color Ball lottery is to conduct statistical modeling and rule mining based on the historical data characteristics of lottery draws. However, it must be clearly stated first: the Double Color Ball is essentially an independent random event, and the winning numbers of each draw have no causal correlation. The core purpose of modeling is not to "predict winning numbers", but to explore the statistical distribution characteristics, occurrence rules, combination features of numbers, etc., so as to provide data-based references for number selection (rather than deterministic conclusions).

The draw rules of the Double Color Ball are as follows: select 6 non-repeating red balls (1-33) and 1 blue ball (1-16). Modeling should be carried out around the dual-dimensional characteristics of red balls + blue balls, and at the same time distinguish three core directions: single number characteristics, combination characteristics, and time series characteristics. The following are implementable modeling angles, analysis dimensions, with supporting modeling methods, covering descriptive statistics, predictive modeling, correlation analysis and other scenarios:

1. Basic Statistical Distribution Modeling: Core Exploration of the "Occurrence Probability Characteristics" of Numbers
This is the foundation of modeling. First, clarify the frequency, probability and distribution rules of single numbers/number segments through statistical analysis, answer questions such as "which numbers/intervals appear more frequently" and "whether the number distribution conforms to the theoretical random distribution", and it is the premise for all subsequent modeling.

1.1 Analysis Dimensions
(1) Single number frequency and probability
- For red balls (1-33): historical draw times, occurrence frequency, omission value (number of consecutive non-draw periods), average omission cycle of each number;
- The same applies to blue balls (1-16) (the sample size of blue balls is smaller, and the distribution characteristics are easier to count).

(2) Number interval distribution
- Divide red balls into intervals by numerical value (e.g., 1-11, 12-22, 23-33, i.e., three-zone division; or 1-8, 9-16, etc., eight zones), and count the distribution of the number of balls falling in each interval in each draw;
- Divide blue balls by odd/even and size (1-8 for small, 9-16 for large), and count the interval frequency.

(3) Numerical feature distribution
- Odd-even property: count the number of odd and even numbers of red balls in each draw (e.g., 4 odd & 2 even, 3 odd & 3 even), and the occurrence frequency of odd and even blue balls;
- Size property: divide red balls into large and small with 17 as the boundary, count the distribution of the number of large and small balls in each draw; divide blue balls into large and small with 8 as the boundary;
- Prime-composite property: distinguish prime numbers (2,3,5…31) and composite numbers for red balls, count the distribution of the number of prime and composite balls.

(4) Theoretical distribution fitting test
- Test whether the occurrence frequency of single numbers conforms to the uniform distribution (the theoretical distribution of random events), and use the chi-square test and K-S test to verify whether the actual draw deviates from randomness;
- Test whether the number omission value conforms to the geometric distribution/Poisson distribution (the interval distribution characteristics of random events).

1.2 Modeling Methods
- Descriptive statistics (frequency, probability, mean, variance);
- Non-parametric tests (chi-square goodness of fit, K-S test);
- Probability distribution fitting (fitting distribution and calculating P-value with scipy.stats in Matlab/Python).

2. Time Series Feature Modeling: Exploration of the "Time Series Rules" of Numbers
Treat the draw numbers as a time series in the order of periods, analyze the change trends, periodicity and autocorrelation of numbers/features over time, answer questions such as "whether the draw probability of a certain number increases after N omitted periods" and "whether a certain feature (such as three-zone distribution) has temporal periodicity".

2.1 Analysis Dimensions
(1) Time series omission characteristics of single numbers
- Construct a "omission value time series" for a single number (the omission value of each period is the number of consecutive non-draw periods of the number), analyze the change trend, peak value (maximum number of omission periods) and regression law of the omission value;
- Count the conditional probability of "drawing after k omitted periods" (e.g., the probability of a red ball being drawn in the next period after 10 omitted periods).

(2) Time series trend of combination features
- Construct time series of odd-even ratio, size ratio and interval ratio of red balls in each period, analyze the fluctuation characteristics of these ratios over time and whether there is a mean reversion trend;
- Construct a time series of the sum value (the sum of 6 red ball values) of red balls in each period, analyze the time series fluctuation, peak/valley distribution and trend of the sum value.

(3) Time series correlation test
- Test the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) of draw numbers/features to judge whether there is a short-term time series correlation (theoretically, there is no significant autocorrelation in random events);
- Analyze the correlation between the numbers of two adjacent periods (e.g., if red ball 10 is drawn in this period, whether adjacent numbers 9/11 are more likely to be drawn in the next period).

2.2 Modeling Methods
- Time series analysis (ACF/PACF plot, ADF stationarity test);
- Trend fitting (linear regression, moving average MA fitting time series trend);
- Conditional probability calculation (frequency statistics based on historical data).

3. Combination Feature Modeling: Exploration of the "Combination Correlation Rules" of Red and Blue Balls
The core of winning the Double Color Ball lottery is number combination, so combination feature modeling is the focus, focusing on the internal combination of red balls and the associated combination of red and blue balls, answering questions such as "which number combinations are more likely to appear at the same time" and "whether there is an associated feature between red and blue balls", divided into two levels: pairwise combination and overall combination.

3.1 Analysis Dimensions (focus on red balls, supplemented by blue balls)
(1) Pairwise combination (number pair) characteristics
- Count the historical draw times of all pairwise combinations of red balls (C(33,2)=528 types), explore high-frequency number pairs (e.g., 12&15, 20&23, etc., which appear at the same time more frequently);
- Count the occurrence frequency of "adjacent number pairs" (e.g.,5&6,28&29) and "same last digit pairs" (e.g.,3&13&23,7&17) of red balls;
- Analyze the pairwise correlation between red and blue balls (e.g., which numbers/intervals of red balls are more likely to appear when blue ball 8 is drawn).

(2) Overall combination numerical characteristics
- Sum value: the sum of 6 red ball values, count the distribution range of the sum value (theoretical range 21-183) and high-frequency sum value interval (the actual draw is mostly concentrated in 80-120);
- Span: maximum value - minimum value of red balls, count the distribution characteristics of the span (high-frequency span is mostly 20-30);
- Consecutive numbers: the number of consecutive numbers of red balls in each period (e.g., no consecutive numbers, 1 group of 2 consecutive numbers, 1 group of 3 consecutive numbers), count the occurrence frequency of different consecutive number types;
- Same last digits: the number of same last digits of red balls in each period (e.g., the simultaneous appearance of 3,13,23 is 1 group of 3 same last digits), count the distribution law of same last digits.

(3) Combination constraint characteristics
- Count the draw frequency of combinations that meet specific constraints (e.g., whether combinations with "3 odd & 3 even + 2 large & 4 small + 2 balls in each of the three zones" appear more frequently);
- Explore low-frequency combinations and analyze the reasons for their non-occurrence (e.g., overly concentrated values, too small span, etc.).

3.2 Modeling Methods
- Association rule mining (Apriori algorithm, screening high-frequency combinations with minimum support/confidence);
- Combination frequency statistics (traversing historical data for counting);
- Cluster analysis (clustering red ball combinations by sum value/span/interval ratio, analyzing the characteristics of each cluster).

4. Clustering and Classification Modeling: "Feature Grouping" for Numbers/Draw Periods
Group numbers/draw periods with similar features through clustering, and build a mapping model of "features-draw results" through classification, answer questions such as "which numbers belong to the same feature cluster" and "whether the next feature type can be predicted by classification based on historical features", which is an advanced modeling direction.

4.1 Analysis Dimensions
(1) Number clustering
- Taking the occurrence frequency, average omission, interval attribute, odd/even/prime-composite attribute of red balls as features, use clustering algorithms to divide 33 red balls into high-frequency stable clusters, low-frequency fluctuation clusters, omission-sensitive clusters, etc.;
- The same applies to blue balls, which are clustered into high-frequency blue balls, medium-frequency blue balls and low-frequency blue balls according to frequency/omission characteristics.

(2) Draw period classification
- Taking the odd-even ratio, size ratio, interval ratio, sum value, span and number of consecutive numbers of each period as features, divide all draw periods into different types (e.g., "balanced type", "odd-biased type", "large-span type");
- Count the occurrence frequency of each type of period and analyze the conversion rules between types (e.g., "balanced type" is more likely to be followed by "even-biased type").

(3) Classification prediction modeling
- Taking the feature set of historical periods as input and the feature type of the next period (e.g., odd-even ratio type, interval ratio type) as output, build a classification model to predict the feature type of the next period (rather than specific numbers).

4.2 Modeling Methods
- Clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering HC, determining the number of clusters by the elbow method);
- Classification algorithms (Decision Tree DT, Random Forest RF, Logistic Regression LR, suitable for scenarios with small sample size/low feature dimension);
- Feature engineering (feature standardization, dimensionality reduction PCA, reducing feature redundancy).

5. Special Modeling for Blue Balls: Precise Analysis of Independent Dimensions
The blue ball is the "winning threshold" of the Double Color Ball (winning the sixth prize by hitting the blue ball), and there are only 16 blue ball numbers with a small sample size and more significant statistical characteristics. Therefore, special modeling is carried out independently with more focused dimensions and more referential conclusions.

5.1 Core Analysis Dimensions
(1) Basic features: single number frequency, omission value, odd/even/size/prime-composite distribution of blue balls;
(2) Time series features: blue ball omission value time series, correlation between blue balls in adjacent periods (e.g., if an even number is drawn in this period, whether an odd number is more likely to be drawn in the next period);
(3) Red-blue correlation: correlation between blue balls and the sum value/odd-even ratio/interval ratio of red balls (e.g., whether the sum value of red balls is larger when a large blue ball is drawn);
(4) Conditional probability: the draw probability of blue balls when "a certain feature of red balls appears" (e.g., the probability of blue balls drawing 1-8 when the sum value of red balls > 120).

5.2 Modeling Methods
- Basic statistics + time series analysis (same as above);
- Bayesian probability model (calculating the posterior probability of red-blue correlation).

6. Risk and Randomness Verification Modeling: Quantifying the "Random Degree of Draws"
This is the verification layer of modeling. After all rule mining, randomness verification is required to judge whether the features are real rules or random fluctuations, so as to avoid mistaking "accidental high frequency" for "inevitable rules", which is an important link of modeling.

6.1 Core Analysis Dimensions
(1) Random simulation verification
- Generate a large number of random simulated draw data (e.g., 10,000 periods) according to the Double Color Ball rules, compare the features (frequency, distribution, combination) of the simulated data with the actual draw data, and judge whether the actual features deviate significantly from randomness;
(2) Significance test
- Conduct hypothesis tests on the mined "high-frequency numbers/high-frequency combinations", with the null hypothesis that "the occurrence probability of the number/combination is consistent with randomness", and judge the significance through the P-value (P<0.05 means significant deviation);
(3) Rule stability verification
- Divide the historical data into training set and test set by time (e.g., the first 80% as the training set and the last 20% as the test set), and verify whether the rules mined in the training set (e.g., high-frequency combinations) are still valid in the test set.

6.2 Modeling Methods
- Monte Carlo random simulation (generating random draw data with Python/Matlab);
- Hypothesis testing (chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test);
- Cross-validation (time series cross-validation to avoid data leakage).

Technical Tools and Data Preparation for Modeling
1. Data source: Complete historical draw data of the Double Color Ball announced on the China Welfare Lottery Network (collect at least the last 1,000 periods, the more periods, the more stable the statistical characteristics), including fields: period number, draw date, red balls 1-6, blue ball, prize pool, number of winning notes, etc.;
2. Data preprocessing: sort red balls by numerical value (eliminate the influence of draw order, because the Double Color Ball has no order requirement), complete missing values, and test abnormal values (there are no actual abnormal values, only format unification is required);
3. Technical tools:
- Basic statistics/modeling: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scipy), Excel (for small data volume);
- Visualization: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau (for interactive visualization);
- Advanced modeling: Python (Scikit-learn, StatsModels), R (better for time series analysis).

Key Modeling Principles (Must Abide by)
1. Abandon "deterministic prediction": Lottery is an independent random event, and any modeling cannot predict specific winning numbers. The value of modeling is data-based reference (e.g., avoiding extremely low-frequency combinations, choosing statistically more balanced combinations);
2. Avoid overfitting: Do not build complex models to fit historical data (e.g., mining complex rules of multi-period correlation), such rules will inevitably fail in future periods;
3. Focus on "feature trends" rather than "single numbers": Predicting specific numbers is meaningless, but feature types can be predicted (e.g., the sum value of red balls in the next period is likely to be 90-110, the odd-even ratio is 3:3), and the accuracy of such predictions is much higher than that of single number predictions;
4. Sufficient sample size: Collect at least more than 1,000 periods of data. The statistical characteristics of short-term data have strong randomness and extremely low reference value.

Modeling Deliverables (Implementable Achievements)
1. Double Color Ball statistical feature report: including visual charts of number frequency, distribution and combination features (frequency histogram, omission value line chart, combination heat map);
2. Rule mining list: high-frequency numbers/combinations, high-frequency feature types, omission value regression rules, etc.;
3. Number selection reference system: number selection constraints based on statistical features (e.g., interval ratio 1:2:3/2:2:2, sum value 80-120, odd-even ratio 3:3);
4. Randomness verification report: comparative analysis of actual data and random simulation data, clarifying which features are real rules and which are random fluctuations.
